# WEB DESIGN RESOURCES

---
## Color Sources
* https://flatuicolors.com
> Been around for ages; good colors, although some may be a bit overused by now.

* https://material.io/color
> Flat colors, but a bit more uniform in the distribution. Wide range of strong colors in a variety of shades.

* http://c0ffee.surge.sh/
> Real-word hex codes for color. Not always the prettiest, but interesting nonetheless.

* https://webkul.github.io/coolhue/
> Clean, largely pastel gradients with CSS definitions.

---
## ICONS
* https://thenounproject.com/
> Very large high-quality curated icon repository, created by designers and provided in SVG and PNG formats.

---
## SVG
* http://www.heropatterns.com/
> A collection of repeatable SVG background patterns.

* http://iros.github.io/patternfills/
> SVG patterns for background fills. Aesthetic is a bit old-school, but useful for graphs, visualizations, etc.

---
## MOCKUPS
* https://dimmy.club/
> Device mockup generator for your screenshots.
